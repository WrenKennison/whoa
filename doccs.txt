hello, whoever is reading. 

these are my notes on this website. 

if yer reading this then I suppose you're running this now?

can't think of anyone else but who knows. 

anyways...

the basic layout is this

- folders for each category of page
	- the MUSIC folder has music related things
		- album pages
		- songs
		- lyrics
		- things
	- the REAL folder has people related things
		- bio pages
		- shows
		- other bands
		- etc
	- the META folder has website related things
		- website pages
		- info pages 
		- etc

within these, just a bin of pages. BUT, each html file is within its own folder, with a CSS file. 

there are 2 reasons: 

1 - every page can have a customized look, since it has its own CSS file, which is conveniently stored right next to it. 
	- most pages will just use the default. but if they DO use a custom one, there's a great spac for it
2 - each file can just be named 'index.html', which means that when you access the page, you won't see a ".html" at the end of the link. 

I personally don't care enough to do this on my own website, but I figure I might as well do it right this time.
