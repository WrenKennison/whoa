    <mark>ESSAY 1: on RULES 06.13.25</mark><br><br>
    the most enjoyable rules to break are the small ones. and here is a small rule: "websites should be useful and user friendly"
    <br><br>
    fuck no. <mark>things made with passion should not be accessible to those who don`t care.</mark> everything doesn`t have to be a product. nobody I know is pretty enough to be in an advertisement. . .  and so what?
    <br><br> (sorry guys)<br><br>

    <mark>ESSAY 2: on LOVE 06.13.25</mark><br><br>
    love is a spectrum and not the gay `people` spectrum and neither `love on the spectrum` (10/10 show by the way) but the idea, alright, is that all human affection is a very long spectrum. a two 
    dimensional or even three dimensional spectrum, at least I hope it is because if `disgust` is somewhere between love and hate I`m in large trouble, though it`d explain a lot
    <br><br>
    anyways, love is a spectrum. or, I guess it`s more accurate to say <i>emotions</i> are a spectrum (ONE spectrum), and love is the tip (see: `the tip who loved me`). 
    <br><br>
    several people I have met have some kinda opinion of affection being in several stages. like you go up the stages and each one adds a different thing, and includes all the things of the 
    last. like sex. (see: `the love who tipped me`) I think this is <mark>wrong.</mark>
    <br><br>
    for example, some people love their parents more than their partners, and only some of them also want to have sex with their parents. 
    <br><br>
    for example, I love music more than anything on earth, and I only sometimes want to have sex with my guitar.
        <br><br>
    [side note: I once stumbled onto a russian guitar forum thread full of photoshops of scantily clad women as guitar]
    <br><br>
    I think it is this thinking which causes so many people to be lonely, especially men. if the pinnacle of `love` is <i>`someone who will [l/k]ick my balls`</i> then you`re avoiding all of the other
    meaningful and fulfilling relationships you can have with all the other people in your life.

        I am both the monkey and the one who throws the banana.
        <br><br>
        This is more or less the four noble truths.
        <br><br>
        life does not need you to be serious all the time. you don`t need to spend all your time preparing for something. you`ll know when you have to be serious.
        <br><br>
        there is a fine line between being very uncaring and dissociation. you should unicycle down the middle.

    <mark>ESSAY 4: on INSANITY IN THE MODERN AGE 06.13.25</mark><br><br>
    Insanity is honestly just psychosis, I think. It's losing your grip on perspective, on context. This is why some people go insane doing easy 9-5 jobs and 
    some are just fine. The ones who do find can see it for what it is, they keep their important self-identity bits out of the limelight and machinework. The people who lose it
    do so because they get caught in it, they forget that any other existence is possible. But modern happenings are so intrusive, prying, demanding; they lose the 
    ability to 'sleep', their brain never gets off the treadmill, out of the flight or fight stage, and worse: they don't realize what's happening at all. 
    <br><br>
    we have styled outselves as godlike unlimited creatures so effectively we forget that we are unchangeably animatlistic at heart. it is not a coincidence that nearly every 
    human alive likes nature sounds and enjoys spending time with others, and many other things like these. most of our modern problems come about because we forget our 
    limitations, our humanity, in a literal sense.
